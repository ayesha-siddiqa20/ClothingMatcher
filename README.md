Live demo: https://ayesha-siddiqa20.github.io/ClothingMatcher/index.html

Explore and create outift combinations that express your unique style. 

This experimental project runs in a node.js server in order to access the camera and upload your own pictures. To be able to do so, go to the terminal and write "node server.js" in the project directory.
